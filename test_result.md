# Test Results - Sparksonic.lu

## Original Problem Statement
Rebuild Sparksonic.lu website with focus on:
1. Multi-language support (EN, FR, DE, LU, ES, PT)
2. Customer portal with authentication
3. SEO optimization
4. Responsive design

## Current Issues Being Fixed

### Issue 1: Multi-language Support
**Problem:** Language switcher only affects homepage, not working on sub-pages (services, projects, portal)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Root Cause:** 
- Two different i18n configurations being used inconsistently
- Sub-pages have hardcoded English text instead of using translations
- Missing languages (LU, ES, PT) in the configuration used by main pages

### Issue 2: Customer Portal Login
**Problem:** Unable to log in with credentials demo@sparksonic.lu / Demo123456
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Root Cause:** Need to verify user exists in database and test authentication flow
