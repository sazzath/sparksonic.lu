The AI engineer was tasked with rebuilding the Sparksonic.lu website, focusing on SEO, responsiveness, multi-language support, and a customer portal. The initial phase successfully established a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, JWT authentication, and API endpoints for health, services, reviews, contact, user registration, login, quotes, and tickets. A significant challenge arose with the SMTP configuration, leading to a temporary mock email service. The frontend development, utilizing Next.js and Tailwind CSS, faced hurdles with environment variable handling, i18n setup, and Tailwind CSS version compatibility. The AI engineer iteratively addressed these issues, debugging build processes, updating dependencies, and refining API client configurations. Current efforts are concentrated on achieving full multi-language functionality across all pages and resolving persistent customer portal login and display issues, including redesigning the portal dashboard.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Language Switcher:** Ensure language changes persist and apply to all content (text, images, headings, dropdowns) on all sub-pages (services, projects) and not just the homepage.
-   **Customer Portal Login:** Investigate and fix why login credentials are not working on the customer portal, despite backend registration being successful.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most immediate work revolves around addressing two critical issues raised by the user:
1.  **Multi-language Support:** The language switcher implemented in the header currently only affects the homepage. The user explicitly stated that language changes are not working on sub-pages like services and projects, and wants all specified languages (English, French, German, Luxembourgish, Spanish, Portuguese) to function correctly across the entire application, including all content elements (text, image headings, dropdowns).
2.  **Customer Portal Login:** The user reported an inability to log in to the customer portal after registration, despite the backend confirming successful registration. Test credentials ( / ) were provided for debugging.

The AI engineer has been attempting to fix these by:
-   **Translations:** Editing  multiple times to add more languages and fix syntax errors related to apostrophes that were causing build failures. A new file, , was created to address issues with  not initializing properly on the client side, aiming to make it work as a client-side hook. Updates were made to  and  to use this new  configuration.
-   **Login:** The backend registration was confirmed to be working (). The focus has shifted to ensuring the  setup correctly loads and functions in the client-side context, as translation issues can sometimes mask or interact with other frontend functionality like authentication forms.

The last action was rebuilding and restarting the frontend after modifying translation-related files, followed by a plan to test translations and login.

<optional_next_step>
Re-implement full multi-language support for all 6 languages across all pages and content elements.
